\section _tests_formats_tests Test Inputs and Outputs

In both test input and test data files, lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments.
Generally, input files should have a header with a brief description and/or the generator
command used to create them. The reference data files should repeat this information and add
the command used to generate the data.

\note In test files, floating point values in the input files are treated as if they are exact to an
      infinite number of decimal places. Integers always have infinite precision.

The computed values for the various integrals are printed (via the functionality in arb) as
a value with associated error radius. This is meant to be interpreted again by the `arb_set_str` function,
although it can certainly be parsed other ways.


\subsection _tests_formats_boys Boys Function Test Files

In a test file for the Boys function, the first (non-comment) line contains three integers

  1. The number of tests in the file
  2. The number of significant figures printed for the value of `F(m,t)`
  3. The working precision used to calculate the value.

After this metadata, each line contains `m`, `t`, and the value of `F(m,t)` for a single integral.

An annotated example of a Boys input file is shown below

\include boys_example.inp 

And here is the corresponding test data file

\include boys_example.dat 


\subsection _tests_formats_integrals General Integral Test Files

The format for an input for general types of integrals (ie, eri) are as follows. The first line
contains the number of tests in the file. Then, there are blocks of inputs containing the shell information for
a specified number of centers (ie, eri = 4 center, overlap = 2 center).

\include 4center_example.inp

\include 4center_example.dat


\subsection _tests_formats_single_integrals Single Integral Test Files


\include 4center_single_example.inp

\include 4center_single_example.dat


\section _tests_fromats_reference Reference File Format


Reference files are printed using hex-float, so they do not suffer from rounding issues.


\include 4center_example.ref
