\section _tests_formats_tests Test Inputs and Outputs

In both test input and test data files, lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments.
Generally, input files should have a header with a brief description and/or the generator
command used to create them. The reference data files should repeat this information and add
the command used to generate the data.

\note In test files, floating point values in the input files are treated as if they are exact to an
      infinite number of decimal places. Integers always have infinite precision.

The computed values for the various integrals are printed (via the functionality in arb) as
a value with associated error radius. This is meant to be interpreted again by the `arb_set_str` function,
although it can certainly be parsed other ways.


\subsection _tests_formats_boys Boys Function Test Files

In a test file for the Boys function, the first (non-comment) line contains three integers

  1. The number of tests in the file
  2. The number of significant figures printed for the value of `F(m,t)`
  3. The working precision used to calculate the value.

After this metadata, each line contains `m`, `t`, and the value of `F(m,t)` for a single integral.

An annotated example of a Boys input file is shown below

\include boys_example.inp 

And here is the corresponding test data file

\include boys_example.dat 


\subsection _tests_formats_integrals General Integral Test Files

The format for an input for general types of integrals (ie, eri) are as follows. The first line
contains the number of tests in the file. Then, there are blocks of inputs containing the shell information for
a specified number of centers (ie, eri = 4 center, overlap = 2 center).

Each shell contains the following information (in order)

  1. The Z number (1 = H, 8 = O, etc)
  2. The angular momentum (integer)
  3. The number of primitives in the shell
  4. The number of general contractions
  5. The coordinates (in bohr)
  6. For each primitive, the exponent and the contraction coefficients for each general contraction
  
For the test data file, the first line contains the number of tests, number of significant figures,
and the working precision used to compute the integrals. After specifying the shells, the
integrals are printed (with the error radius). The integral is prefixed with an index of that
integral in the shell quartet.

Below is an example of an input file for a 4-center integral

\include 4center_example.inp

And blow is an example of the corresponding test data file (when the above input is used in an ERI calculation)

\include 4center_example.dat


\subsection _tests_formats_single_integrals Single Integral Test Files

The formats for single integral test files are simpler than the general integral counterpart.

For an input, the first line is again the number of tests. Then, there are blocks
of inputs containing information for a single cartesian integral, for the specified
number of centers.

  1. The Z number (1 = H, 8 = O, etc)
  2. Values of i,j,k (exponents of x,y,z which control the cartesian component)
  3. Coordinates (in borh)
  4. Exponent of the primitive

The ijk specify which cartesian component that center is (for example, ijk=(1,2,0) is is a fxyy orbital).

Similar to the general integrals, the test data file is similar to the input file, except
that the first line contains the number of tests, number of significant figures,
and the working precision. The value of the computed integral is given after the specification
for the centers, and does not have an index number.

Below is an example of an input for a 4-center single integral

\include 4center_single_example.inp

And below is the corresponding data file (when the above input is used in an ERI calculation)

\include 4center_single_example.dat


\section _tests_fromats_reference Reference File Format


Reference files are printed using hex-float for floating point precision, so they do not suffer from rounding issues.

The first section of the file describes the basis set. First, the number of shells is printed.
Then, the data for each shell is provided.

  1. The Z number (1 = H, 8 = O, etc)
  2. The angular momentum (integer)
  3. The number of primitives in the shell
  4. The number of general contractions
  5. The coordinates (in bohr)

The next line contains all the primitives. Then, for each general contraction, the coefficients
for all the primitives are printed (each general contraction on a separate line).

\note This is different than the test file specification - the contraction coefficients are
      printed as the transpose in the reference files.

After this basis section, the computed integrals for each (contracted) are printed, with the indices
of each of the shells printed before the integrals. These (zero-based) indices correspond to the shells
in the basis section.

A code sample for reading reference files in C++ can be found in the `examples` subdirectory.

Below is an annotated example of a reference file

\include 4center_example.ref
