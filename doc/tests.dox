/*! \page tests Testing, Test Files, and Reference Files

\section _tests_general General Information

MIRP can create two different types of files - reference files and test files.
While they can both be created and used by MIRP, they serve two different purposes.

\note For details on the formats of these files, see \ref tests_formats


\section _tests_reffiles Reference Files

Reference files are meant to be used by integral packages to validate their own implementation.
These files contain integrals derived from a molecule and basis set, and computed
to 'exact' double precision (see \ref _functiontypes_single_exact).
Reference files have a `.ref` extension, and are created with the
`mirp_create_reference` executable. They can also be tested/verified with the
`mirp_verify_reference` executable.

Examples of how to read a reference file can be found in the `examples` subdirectory of the MIRP source.


\section _tests_testfiles Test Files

Test files are meant to verify the internal implementation of MIRP itself.
The inputs and computed integrals are stored in interval arithmetic (via the Arb library) with
the calculated error bars. Inputs for test file creation have a `.inp` extension, and
the actual outputs have a `.dat` extension. The test output files are created
via `mirp_create_test` and then later tested with `mirp_verify_test`.

To create a new test file, a test input file must first be created. This can be created
by any means, although it must conform to the input test file format (see \ref _tests_formats_tests).
Scripts that generate test inputs should be placed in the `generator` subdirectory
of the `tests` directory.

Once an input is created, the reference data file can be created via the `mirp_create_test` command.
Once a test has been created and verified, its sha256sum should be added to the `sha256sums`
file in the `tests` directory. This will help protect against inadvertent changes.

Functionality in MIRP can then be tested using the `mirp_verify_test` command. These types
of tests are typically added to a CMake script in the `tests` directory of the MIRP repo so
that they can be run via `ctest`.


\subsection _tests_verify Test Verification

When possible, the reference test data must be verified by another means. Scripts, Mathematica notebooks, etc,
that do this should be placed in the `verify` subdirectory of the `tests` directory.
