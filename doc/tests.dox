/*! \page tests Creating Test Files

\section _tests_general General Test Information

See \ref fileformat for information about the file formatting for test files.

To create a new test file, an input file must first be created. This can be created
by any means, although it must conform to the input test file format.

Then, the reference data file can be created via the `mirp_create_test` command.

\section _tests_verify Test Verification

The reference test data must be verified by another means. Scripts, Mathematica notebooks, etc,
should be placed in the `verify` subdirectory of the `test_data` directory.

\section _tests_shasum Checksumming

Once a test has been created and verified, its sha256sum should be added to the `sha256sums`
file in the `test_data` directory.
