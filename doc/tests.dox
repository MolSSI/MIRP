/*! \page tests Testing, Test Files, and Reference Files

\section _tests_general General Test Information

Test data resides in the `tests` subdirectory of the MIRP repo.

To create a new test file, an input file must first be created. This can be created
by any means, although it must conform to the input test file format (see \ref _tests_formats).
Scripts that generate test inputs should be placed in the `generator` subdirectory
of the `tests` directory.

Once an input is created, the reference data file can be created via the `mirp_create_test` command.
Typically, input files have a `.inp` suffix, while the reference data generated from inputs
has a `.dat` suffix.

Once a test has been created and verified, its sha256sum should be added to the `sha256sums`
file in the `tests` directory. This will help protect against inadvertent changes.

Functionality in MIRP can then be tested using the `mirp_verify_test` command. This is
typically added to a CMake script in the `tests` directory of the MIRP repo.



\section _tests_verify Test Verification

When possible, the reference test data must be verified by another means. Scripts, Mathematica notebooks, etc,
that do this should be placed in the `verify` subdirectory of the `tests` directory.


\section _tests_formats Test file formats

In both test input and reference files, lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments.
Generally, input files should have a header with a brief description and/or the generator
command used to create them. The reference data files should repeat this information and add
the command used to generate the data.

\note Floating point values in the input files are treated as if they are exact to an infinite number of decimal places.
      Integers always have infinite precision.

The computed values for the various integrals are printed (via the functionality in arb) as
a value with associated error radius. This is meant to be interpreted again by the `arb_set_str` function,
although it can certainly be parsed other ways.


\subsection _tests_formats_boys Boys Function Test Files

In a test file for the Boys function, the first (non-comment) line contains three integers

  1. The number of tests in the file
  2. The number of significant figures printed for the value of `F(m,t)`
  3. The working precision used to calculate the value.

After this metadata, each line contains `m`, `t`, and the value of `F(m,t)` for a single integral.

An example of a Boys input file is shown below

\include boys_fordoc.inp 

And here is the corresponding test data file

\include boys_fordoc.dat 


\subsection _tests_formats_integrals General Integral Test Files

The format for an input for general types of integrals (ie, eri) are as follows. The first line
contains the number of tests in the file. Then, there are blocks of inputs containing the shell information for
a specified number of centers (ie, eri = 4 center, overlap = 2 center).

\include 4center_fordoc.inp

\include eri_fordoc.dat
